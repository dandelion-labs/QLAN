Simple Sinclair QL Network File Server
(C) Jason Lucas 2019

This is a work in progress. It may contain bugs. Use with caution.

Provides an inexpensive way of transferring data to and from a QL using
the QL network interface.

Notes:

Only one file can be opened at once.

Executable files will need a 15 byte file header added to the start of the file

Some versions of Toolkit 2 have a bug in the LOAD command, incorrectly requiring BASIC programs
to have a file header - A fix for this has been provided an can be activated/deactivate by setting
the useTK2Fix variable in the source code (default: true)

In some combinations of Toolkit 2 and Minerva ROM, networking does not work correctly - either update your ROMS
to the latest version, or either disable TK2 or Minerva.

Commands:

There are two versions of the commands code - one just as SuperBASIC procedures (net)
and one compiled as a QLiberator extension (net_obj). To use the latter, you will need a copy of
the QLiberator runtime (QLib_run)
An example boot file is included to load the QLib extension version of the commands

NFILE "filename"    - sets the currently active SD file
NDIR                - view the current SD directory
NDEL "filename"     - delete a file
NCHDIR "path"       - change the current directory
NMKDIR "path"       - create a new directory
NRMDIR "path"       - delete a directory (it must be empty)
NMOVE "file1" "file2" - move a file

Saving and loading files:

Once the filename has been set using the NFILE command,
files can be loaded/saved/executed using the network address 63

e.g
Load a BASIC file:

NFILE "somefile"
LOAD neti_63

Save a BASIC file:

NFILE "somefile"
SAVE neto_63

Execute a file:

NFILE "somefile"
EXEC_W neti_63


Save a screenshot

NFILE "somefile"
SBYTES neto_63,131072,32768

Load a screenshot

NFILE "somefile"
LBYTES neti_63,131072
